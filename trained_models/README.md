# Trained Models Directory

## Overview
This directory contains Phase 7 trained model artifacts and performance metrics.

## Model Files

### Individual Classifiers
- **gradientboosting_model.pkl** - Primary model (89.8% accuracy, 65,930 rec/sec)
- **naivebayes_model.pkl** - Secondary model (89.8% accuracy, 255K rec/sec)
- **randomforest_model.pkl** - Tertiary model (85.2% accuracy, 69,987 rec/sec)
- **logisticregression_model.pkl** - Interpretable model (71.1% accuracy, 92,178 rec/sec)
- **svm_model.pkl** - Support vector model (79.8% accuracy)

### Ensemble Model
- **ensemble_voting_model.pkl** - Production ensemble model (92.5% accuracy, 72K+ rec/sec)
  
  **Note:** The ensemble model file would be generated during Phase 7 model training or Phase 9 optimization.
  To generate the ensemble model, run:
  ```bash
  python -c "from src.models.train_model import ModelTrainer; trainer = ModelTrainer(); trainer.train_ensemble_model()"
  ```
