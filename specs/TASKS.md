- [ ] **Data Pipeline Documentation:**
  ```markdown
  ## Data Flow
  1. bmarket.db → data/raw/initial_dataset.csv (SQLite extraction)
  2. data/raw/ → data/processed/cleaned-db.csv (cleaning pipeline)
  3. data/processed/ → data/featured/featured_data.csv (feature engineering)
  4. data/featured/ → trained_models/ (model training)
  5. trained_models/ → predictions/ (inference pipeline)

  Format Decision: CSV-based pipeline (optimal for 41K records)
  ```
