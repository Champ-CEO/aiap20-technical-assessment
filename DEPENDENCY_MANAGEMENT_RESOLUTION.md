# Dependency Management Resolution Report

## Overview

Successfully resolved dependency management discrepancies between `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` files, establishing `requirements.txt` as the single source of truth for project dependencies as required by submission guidelines.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Version Conflicts
**Issue:** Inconsistent pytest versions
- `requirements.txt`: `pytest>=7.3.1`
- `pyproject.toml`: `pytest>=8.3.5` (main) and `pytest>=7.3.1` (dev)

**Resolution:** Standardized to `pytest>=8.3.5` in requirements.txt

### 2. Missing Dependencies
**Issue:** Dependencies present in one file but not the other
- `ipykernel>=6.29.0`: Only in pyproject.toml dev dependencies
- `psutil>=5.9.0`: Only in requirements.txt
- `joblib>=1.3.0`: Used in codebase but not explicitly listed

**Resolution:** Added all missing dependencies to requirements.txt

### 3. Organizational Inconsistencies
**Issue:** Different dependency organization approaches
- pyproject.toml: Separated core and dev dependencies
- requirements.txt: All dependencies in one file

**Resolution:** Consolidated all dependencies into requirements.txt with clear sections

### 4. Documentation Inconsistencies
**Issue:** README.md referenced both installation methods
- `pip install -e .` (pyproject.toml)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Resolution:** Updated README.md to reference only requirements.txt

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated requirements.txt
```diff
# Testing
- pytest>=7.3.1
+ pytest>=8.3.5
pytest-cov>=4.0.0
psutil>=5.9.0

# Machine Learning
scikit-learn>=1.2.0
+ joblib>=1.3.0

# Documentation and Development
jupyter>=1.0.0
jupyterlab>=4.0.0
+ ipykernel>=6.29.0
```

### 2. Updated pyproject.toml
```diff
- dependencies = [
-     "pandas>=2.0.0",
-     "numpy>=1.24.0",
-     ...
- ]
- 
- [project.optional-dependencies]
- dev = [
-     "black>=23.3.0",
-     ...
- ]

+ # Dependencies are managed via requirements.txt for project submission requirements
+ # Install dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Updated README.md
```diff
- # Install dependencies using pip
- pip install -e .
- 
- # Or install with development dependencies
- pip install -e ".[dev]"

+ # Install dependencies
+ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```diff
- ├── pyproject.toml         # Project configuration and dependencies
- └── requirements.txt       # Legacy dependency file

+ ├── pyproject.toml         # Project metadata and build configuration
+ └── requirements.txt       # Project dependencies (primary dependency file)
```

## Final Dependency List

### Core Dependencies (requirements.txt)
- **Data Processing:** pandas>=2.0.0, numpy>=1.24.0, requests>=2.31.0, tabulate>=0.9.0
- **Visualization:** matplotlib>=3.7.0, seaborn>=0.12.0, plotly>=5.13.0
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn>=1.2.0, joblib>=1.3.0
- **Testing:** pytest>=8.3.5, pytest-cov>=4.0.0, psutil>=5.9.0
- **Code Quality:** black>=23.3.0, isort>=5.12.0, flake8>=6.0.0, mypy>=1.0.0
- **Development:** jupyter>=1.0.0, jupyterlab>=4.0.0, ipykernel>=6.29.0

### Project Configuration (pyproject.toml)
- **Project Metadata:** name, version, description, authors, classifiers
- **Build System:** setuptools>=61.0
- **Tool Configurations:** black, isort, flake8, mypy settings

## Verification

### 1. Dependency Consistency
✅ All packages used in codebase are included in requirements.txt
✅ No version conflicts between dependency specifications
✅ All imports have corresponding package entries

### 2. Installation Method
✅ Single installation command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
✅ README.md updated with consistent instructions
✅ pyproject.toml no longer specifies dependencies

### 3. Project Structure
✅ requirements.txt as single source of truth
✅ pyproject.toml for metadata and build configuration only
✅ Clear separation of concerns

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Compliance:** Meets project submission requirements for requirements.txt
2. **Consistency:** Single source of truth eliminates version conflicts
3. **Simplicity:** One installation command for all dependencies
4. **Maintainability:** Clear dependency organization with comments
5. **Compatibility:** Standard pip workflow for dependency management

## Installation Instructions

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Unix/macOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusion

Dependency management has been successfully consolidated to use requirements.txt as the single source of truth, resolving all identified discrepancies and ensuring compliance with project submission guidelines. The solution maintains all necessary dependencies while simplifying the installation process and eliminating version conflicts.
