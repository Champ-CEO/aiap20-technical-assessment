Phase 9 Model Selection and Optimization - Step 1: Smoke Tests
TDD Implementation for Model Selection Core Requirements

Based on Phase 8 evaluation results:
- GradientBoosting: 90.1% accuracy, 65,930 rec/sec (Primary Model)
- NaiveBayes: 89.8% accuracy, 78,084 rec/sec (Secondary Model)
- RandomForest: 85.2% accuracy, 69,987 rec/sec (Tertiary Model)
- 6,112% ROI potential identified
- Customer segments: Premium, Standard, Basic

SMOKE TESTS (4 tests) - Core model selection requirements:
1. Phase 8 model selection validation: Confirm GradientBoosting (90.1% accuracy) as optimal primary model
2. Ensemble method smoke test: Top 3 models combination works without errors
3. Hyperparameter optimization smoke test: GradientBoosting parameter tuning process executes correctly
4. Production readiness smoke test: Models meet Phase 8 performance standards

Expected TDD Red Phase: All tests should initially FAIL, guiding Step 2 implementation.
