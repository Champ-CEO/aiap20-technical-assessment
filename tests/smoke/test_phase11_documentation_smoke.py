"""
Phase 11 Step 1: Documentation Smoke Tests

TDD implementation for Phase 11 documentation requirements.
These tests define the requirements before implementing core functionality.

Test Coverage:
- README rendering and readability validation
- Code examples execution (main.py, run.sh) with Phase 10 infrastructure
- Quick start setup with infrastructure requirements (16 CPU, 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 10Gbps)
- Business clarity for non-technical stakeholders (92.5% ensemble accuracy, 6,112% ROI)
- Production readiness documentation for 3-tier architecture

Expected Result: TDD Red Phase - Tests should fail until Step 2 implementation
