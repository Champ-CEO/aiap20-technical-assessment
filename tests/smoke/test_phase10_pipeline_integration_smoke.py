"""
Phase 10 Step 1: Pipeline Integration Smoke Tests

TDD implementation for Phase 10 pipeline integration requirements.
These tests define the requirements before implementing core functionality.

Test Coverage:
- End-to-end pipeline (bmarket.db â†’ predictions) with Phase 9 ensemble methods
- Model integration (Ensemble Voting 92.5% + 3-tier architecture)
- Performance validation (72,000 rec/sec ensemble, >97K rec/sec standard)
- Phase 9 modules integration (all 9 optimization modules)
- Execution validation (main.py and run.sh with Phase 9 artifacts)

Expected Result: TDD Red Phase - Tests should fail until Step 2 implementation
