Phase 11 Step 1: Documentation Integration Tests

TDD implementation for Phase 11 comprehensive documentation integration requirements.
These tests validate cross-component documentation consistency and integration
before implementing core functionality.

Test Coverage:
- Cross-reference validation between README, main.py, and run.sh
- Phase 10 achievements integration in documentation
- Business and technical documentation consistency
- Documentation workflow integration
- Stakeholder communication integration

Expected Result: TDD Red Phase - Tests should fail until Step 2 implementation
