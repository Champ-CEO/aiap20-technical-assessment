Phase 10 Step 1: Comprehensive Pipeline Integration Tests

TDD implementation for Phase 10 comprehensive integration requirements.
These tests validate end-to-end integration scenarios before implementing core functionality.

Test Coverage:
- Complete pipeline integration with all Phase 9 modules
- End-to-end data flow validation (bmarket.db â†’ predictions)
- Performance benchmarking with Phase 9 standards
- Business workflow integration with customer segments
- Production deployment readiness validation

Expected Result: TDD Red Phase - Tests should fail until Step 2 implementation
