Phase 9 Model Selection and Optimization - Step 1: Critical Tests
TDD Implementation for Optimization Requirements

Based on Phase 8 evaluation results:
- Customer segment ROI: Premium (6,977%), Standard (5,421%), Basic (3,279%)
- Combined model performance target: >90.1% accuracy baseline
- Feature optimization based on Phase 8 validated feature importance
- Production requirements: >65K rec/sec real-time, >78K rec/sec batch
- Performance monitoring: 90.1% accuracy and 6,112% ROI preservation

CRITICAL TESTS (5 tests) - Optimization requirements:
1. Business criteria validation: Marketing ROI optimization using customer segment findings
2. Ensemble validation: Combined model performance exceeds 90.1% accuracy baseline
3. Feature optimization validation: Optimize feature set based on Phase 8 feature importance
4. Deployment feasibility validation: Models meet production requirements
5. Performance monitoring validation: Implement drift detection for accuracy and ROI preservation

Expected TDD Red Phase: All tests should initially FAIL, guiding Step 2 implementation.
