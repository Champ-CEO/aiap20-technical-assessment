Phase 11 Step 1: Documentation Critical Tests

TDD implementation for Phase 11 critical documentation requirements.
These tests define the comprehensive requirements before implementing core functionality.

Test Coverage:
- Completeness validation with Phase 10 infrastructure specs
- Accuracy validation with performance metrics (72K+ rec/sec ensemble, >97K optimization)
- Business validation with customer segment rates (Premium: 31.6%, Standard: 57.7%, Basic: 10.7%)
- Operational validation with Phase 10 procedures (startup, monitoring, troubleshooting)
- Technical validation with actual data flow (bmarket.db â†’ subscription_predictions.csv)
- API documentation validation for all 9 Phase 10 endpoints
- Monitoring validation with real-time metrics and alerting procedures
- Security validation with data protection and backup procedures

Expected Result: TDD Red Phase - Tests should fail until Step 2 implementation
