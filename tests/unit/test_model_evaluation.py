Phase 8 Model Evaluation Tests - Step 1: TDD Requirements Definition

Comprehensive test suite for Phase 8 Model Evaluation following TDD approach:

SMOKE TESTS (6 tests) - Core model evaluation requirements:
1. Phase 7 integration: Load all 5 trained models from trained_models/ directory
2. Performance metrics: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC for all models
3. Model comparison: Ranking logic with actual Phase 7 results (89.8%, 89.5%, 84.6%, 78.8%, 71.4%)
4. Visualization: Generate performance charts and feature importance plots
5. Report generation: Evaluation report saves with Phase 7 artifacts

CRITICAL TESTS (6 tests) - Business-focused evaluation requirements:
1. Production deployment validation: 3-tier model strategy (Primary: GradientBoosting, Secondary: RandomForest, Tertiary: NaiveBayes)
2. Performance monitoring: 89.8% accuracy baseline and model drift detection
3. Business metrics: Customer segment awareness (Premium: 31.6%, Standard: 57.7%, Basic: 10.7%)
4. Feature importance: Phase 7 findings (Client ID, Previous Contact Days, contact_effectiveness_score)
5. Speed performance: Maintain 255K records/second standard
6. Ensemble evaluation: Combine top 3 models for enhanced accuracy

Expected Outcome: 12 failing tests (TDD red phase) to guide Step 2 implementation.
Based on Phase 7 completion: 5 production-ready models with comprehensive performance analysis.
