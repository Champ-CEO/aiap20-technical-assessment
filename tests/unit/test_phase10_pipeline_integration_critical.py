Phase 10 Step 1: Pipeline Integration Critical Tests

TDD implementation for Phase 10 production requirements.
These tests define critical production requirements before implementing core functionality.

Test Coverage:
- Full workflow validation with customer segment ROI tracking
- Model selection strategy with ensemble methods and failover
- Feature importance integration from Phase 9 optimization
- Performance monitoring with 92.5% baseline and 5% drift detection
- Business metrics validation with Phase 9 business criteria optimization
- Infrastructure validation meeting Phase 9 requirements

Expected Result: TDD Red Phase - Tests should fail until Step 2 implementation
